        <h2 class="section-title text-center text-primary">Helping You Align Purpose and Profession</h2>
        <p>As a faith-driven founder rooted in Greensboro, North Carolina, I partner with individuals to uncover the identity and gifts God has given them and translate that into tangible steps for vocational and personal impact. We focus on clarity, practical practices, and God-centered leadership so your work becomes a place of flourishing for you and those you influence.</p>
        <p>Through guided discovery, coaching conversations, and practical frameworks, we help founders and leaders move from uncertainty into sustained momentum — building organizations and families shaped by purpose and love.</p>

              <p>Many founders begin with excitement and vision, then discover momentum fading after the first several months. This reflection explores practical spiritual disciplines and truth declarations that restore endurance and clarity, helping founders reclaim small wins and move forward with resilience.</p>

              <p>When momentum fades, we focus on small, faithful practices: regular rhythms of prayer and rest, honest community checkpoints, and measurable micro-goals. Choose truth over lies and small wins over dramatic leaps. Persistence + truth = harvest in due season.</p>

              <p>Waiting is rarely passive. It's a sacred refining process where dependence grows and unnecessary things are stripped away. We explore how stillness and faithful small steps prepare heart and strategy for the next open door.</p>
